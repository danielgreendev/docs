## Usage

The `PrimarySale` extension is an _abstract contract_, and expects you to implement the following functions by yourself:

| Name                                                                                                      | Type                    | Parameters | Returns | Description                                                                                                                     |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------- | ---------- | ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [`_canSetPrimarySaleRecipient`](/solidity/extension-contracts/primarysale#_cansetprimarysalerecipient) | internal view _virtual_ | n/a        | `bool`  | Runs on every attempt to set a new primary sale recipient. Returns whether this info can be set in the given execution context. |

This is an example smart contract demonstrating how to use this extension.

## Base Contracts Implementing This Extension

## Full API Reference

### primarySaleRecipient

```solidity
function primarySaleRecipient() public view returns (address);
```

- Returns the primary sale recipient address stored in the contract.
- Set this value using the `setPrimarySaleRecipient` function.

### setPrimarySaleRecipient

```solidity
function setPrimarySaleRecipient(address saleRecipient) external;
```

- Lets an authorized wallet set the primary sale recipient address.
- Parameter `saleRecipient`: The address to set as the new primary sale recipient.
- The `_canSetPrimarySaleRecipient` function is run on every call to this function. If the return value of `_canSetPrimarySaleRecipient` is `false`, the `setPrimarySaleRecipient` call will revert.

### \_setupPrimarySaleRecipient

```solidity
function _setupPrimarySaleRecipient(address saleRecipient) internal;
```

- Sets the primary sale recipient.
- Parameter `saleRecipient`: The address to set as the new primary sale recipient.
- The `_canSetPrimarySaleRecipient` function is _not_ run on a call to this function.

### \_canSetPrimarySaleRecipient

```solidity
function _canSetPrimarySaleRecipient() internal view virtual returns (bool);
```

- Runs on every `setPrimarySaleRecipient` function call.
- Returns whether a new primary sale recipient can be set in the given execution context.
- For example, this function can check whether the wallet calling `setPrimarySaleRecipient` is the contract owner, and enforce that only the current owner should be able to successfully call `setPrimarySaleRecipient`.
