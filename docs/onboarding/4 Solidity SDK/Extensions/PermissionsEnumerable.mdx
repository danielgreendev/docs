# PermissionsEnumerable

```solidity
import "@thirdweb-dev/contracts/extension/PermissionsEnumerable.sol";
```

<div className="heroGrid">

<p>
  Add PermissionsEnumerable to your smart contract to control which addresses can perform
  certain actions.
</p>

The `PermissionsEnumerable` extension provides role-based access control: you can create roles and write custom logic in your smart contract that depends on whether a given wallet holds a given role.

There are two different contracts you can implement to add PermissionsEnumerable:

- `PermissionsEnumerable`: Create roles and restrict access to functions based on those roles.
- `PermissionsEnumerableEnumerable`: `PermissionsEnumerable` plus the capability to view all the addresses holding a specific role (or all roles).

You only need to implement **one** of the two.

## Usage

This is an example smart contract demonstrating how to use this extension.

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

import "@thirdweb-dev/contracts/extension/PermissionsEnumerable.sol";

contract MyContract is PermissionsEnumerable {
    // Any `bytes32` value is a valid role. You can create roles by defining them like this.
    bytes32 public constant NUMBER_ROLE = keccak256("NUMBER_ROLE");

    // See comments for `setNumber`, below.
    uint256 public number;

    /**
     *  The `PermissionsEnumerable` contract makes an already defined role available: the `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE`.
     *
     *  As an EXAMPLE, we grant the deployer of the contract this admin role.
     */
    constructor() {
        _setupRole(DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE, msg.sender);
    }

    /**
     *  EXAMPLE: here we have a function that we want to restrict only to holders of `NUMBER_ROLE`.
     *
     *  To accomplish this, we use the `onlyRole` modifier made available by `PermissionsEnumerable`, and
     *  pass it `NUMBER_ROLE` as an argument.
     */
    function setNumber(uint256 _newNumber) public onlyRole(NUMBER_ROLE) {
        number = _newNumber;
    }
}
```

## SDK Usage

By adding this extension to a smart contract, the following features, hooks and functions are unlocked in the SDK:

## Dashboard Usage

By adding this extension to a smart contract, the following features are unlocked on the contract [Dashboard](/dashboard)

## Availability in base contracts

The `PermissionsEnumerable` and `PermissionsEnumerableEnumerable` extensions are _not_ already included in any [base contracts](/solidity/base-contracts). To use this extension, check out the [implementation guide](/solidity/extension-contracts/platformfee#implementing-the-contract-extension) and [full API reference](/solidity/extension-contracts/PermissionsEnumerable#full-api-reference).

## Full API Reference

### hasRole

```solidity
function hasRole(bytes32 role, address account) external view returns (bool);
```

- Returns `true` if `account` has been granted `role`.

### getRoleAdmin

```solidity
function getRoleAdmin(bytes32 role) external view returns (bytes32);
```

- Returns the admin role that controls `role` i.e. the holders of the admin role (the return value) can grant or revoke `role` from wallets.

### grantRole

```solidity
function grantRole(bytes32 role, address account) external;
```

- Grants `role` to `account`. Can only be called by a holder of the admin role of the role being granted.

### revokeRole

```solidity
function revokeRole(bytes32 role, address account) external;
```

- Revokes `role` from `account`. Can only be called by a holder of the admin role of the role being granted.

### renounceRole

```solidity
function renounceRole(bytes32 role, address account) external;
```

- Revokes `role` from the calling account.

### hasRoleWithSwitch

```solidity
function hasRoleWithSwitch(bytes32 role, address account) public view returns (bool);
```

- Returns `true` if `account` has been granted `role`.
- Role restrictions can be swtiched on and off:
  - If `address(0)` has `role`, then the role restrictions don't apply i.e. this function will always return `true`.
  - If `address(0)` does not have `role`, then the role restrictions will apply i.e. this function will behave like `hasRole`.

### getRoleMember (PermissionsEnumerableEnumerable)

```solidity
function getRoleMember(bytes32 role, uint256 index) external view returns (address);
```

- Returns one of the accounts that have `role`. `index` must be a value between 0 and the value of `getRoleMemberCount` at the time, non-inclusive.

### getRoleMemberCount (PermissionsEnumerableEnumerable)

```solidity
function getRoleMemberCount(bytes32 role) external view returns (uint256);
```

- Returns the number of accounts that have `role`. Can be used together with `getRoleMember` to enumerate all bearers of a role.
